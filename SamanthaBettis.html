      <h2>Something I learned</h2>
      <h5>I actually learned a lot of things that are super useful with coding, and or making a website look like you imagined. I think this whole process has opened my eyes even if I'm going to be an acccountant, on my resume I could say that I know basic HTML language to further my carrer.Making a website was a lot easier than anticipated, becuase a full wall of code will always look a little crazy at first. By the second day pretty much everything made sense in my mind with how to code and design a full page.I learned how to put images in a website, make a suiteable header, and create actual working links to things.</h5>
	 <h5> This class has taught me about how coders normally effectively work off of each other when a problem occurs. With reserching things that other coders have done, I fixed a lot of problems I had with just a click and a few words in my code.Plus with the quick work happening all the time I think my typing has been a lot quicker, but I'm still a grandma when I look at a computer becuase of a stigmatism.All in all I've just learned how easy coding is actually to grasp and use for effective, and professional purposes.</h5>

      <h2>Describe HTML</h2>
      <h5>HTML language basically sets up a websites functions, and the links or pictures or words on a websites pages. HTML provides how a website is set up with how things are placed on a websites surface, and the foundations of coding to even make it an actual website and not just random words in a box.In coding HTML is the literal beginning and end of a websitew with the beginning being setting it as an actual HTML, and the end having a footer and a slash to tie everything together. This language is universal as well, anyone can use it to make any website they would like from the ground up.</h5>

      <h2>Describe CSS</h2>
      <h5>CSS language is what makes a website pretty, and cohessive for the look you want a website to have. The color shceme is set up in the code, as well as different collums and fonts that can be used through a website. This is what makes a website go from a black white page to an intersesing set up of a page with colors and resized shapes around words set up in HTML's basic codes.Pretty much CSS turns a page from nothing to something, using its own coding language to work above the foundations of HTML. </h5>
